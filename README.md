## Objective
The main objective of this tool is to provide the user an easy way to create, manipulate and run pipelines to analyze EEG and MEG data. Only the pre-processing steps have been implemented (see processes [here](https://github.com/CorentinLabelle/Brainstorm-Tool/tree/main/domain/process/README.md)).

## Usage
### With MATLAB
The tool can be use through a graphical user interface (GUI) or with custom scripts in MATLAB.
#### Requirements
- [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction)

### Without MATLAB
An [automated version](https://github.com/CorentinLabelle/Brainstorm-Tool/blob/main/automatedTool/README.md) of the tool can be use without a MATLAB license. It requires to have the MATLAB Runtime installed (free installation [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)).
#### Requirements
- [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) (R2022a)
- [Brainstorm Tool bin](https://github.com/CorentinLabelle/Brainstorm-Tool/tree/main/bst_bin/R2022a)

### On CBRAIN
The [automated version](https://github.com/CorentinLabelle/Brainstorm-Tool/blob/main/automatedTool/README.md) of the tool is available on [CBRAIN](https://mcin.ca/technology/cbrain/). See [Implementation on CBRAIN](https://github.com/CorentinLabelle/Brainstorm-Tool/tree/main/CBrain_implementation).
