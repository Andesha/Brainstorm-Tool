# Roadmap
Last updated: November 2nd, 2021

## Analysis Tool

### MEG/EEG Pre-processing
July 2021
- [x] Noth Filter
- [x] Band-Pass Filter
- [x] Power Spectrum Density
- [x] Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

### MEG Pre-processing 
July 2021
- [x] Convert Epochs to Continue
- [x] Detect Artifact
- [x] Remove Simultaneous Events
- [x] Signal-Space Projection (SSP)

### EEG Pre-processing 
August 2021
- [x] Add EEG Positions
- [x] Refine Registration
- [x] Project Electrodes on Scalp
- [x] Detect Heartbeat
- [x] Import Events
- [x] Average Reference

### File Formats 
September 2021
- [x] BIDS
- [x] Events File
- [x] Provenance File
- [x] Evaluate Potential Loss of Data when Converting to EDF
- [x] Allow conversion to BIDS for raw and pre-processed studies

November 2021
- [ ] Testing on new Datasets to support different File Format

### Processing 
November 2021
- [x] Import Events: Epoching for every Event occurance (Time Window, Baseline)
- [ ] Reject Bad Trials: Remove trials with anecdotic Artifacts
- [ ] Evoked Response: Averaging by Condition or by Subject
- [ ] Time/Frequency: Time Frequency Decomposition / Morlet's Wavelength / Multitaper
- [ ] Hilbert: "Zooming on one Frequence"
- [ ] Connectivity: Phase Locking Value/ Coherence 
- [ ] Statistics


## Analysis Tool Testing
September 2021
- [x] Fix Bugs Detected by Students
- [x] Improve Tool Based on Students Reviews

## Pipeline Builder
Ocotber 2021
- [x] Add possibility to build, save and import pipelines to run on new dataset.

## Online EEGNet Analysis Tool
September-October 2021
- [x] Contact Felix-Antoine Fortin for Potential Solutions

December 2021
- [ ] Waiting for the Technical Committee to define priorities
- [ ] Testing import of Datasets in EEGNet
